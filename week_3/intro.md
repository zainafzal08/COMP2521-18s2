> Write BagNumUniq

> If we have three 8-bit unsigned char variables, x, y and z with the following initial values:

```
x == 0xCC    y == 0x55     z == 0
```

then what is the value of z (as an 8-bit quantity) after each of the following statements:

* [AND] `z = x & y;`
* [OR ] `z = x | y;`
* [XOR] `z = x ^ y;`
* [COM] `z = ~x;`
* [COM] `z = ~y;`
* [LSH] `z = x << 1;`
* [RSH] `z = x >> 1;`
* `z = y & (~0x1);`
* `z = y & (0x1 << 3);`
* `z = (x << 2) | (y >> 1);`
